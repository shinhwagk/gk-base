Maximum number of applications in the system which can be concurrently active both running and pending. 
Limits on each queue are directly proportional to their queue capacities and user limits.
This is a hard limit and any applications submitted when this limit is reached will be rejected.
Default is 10000. 
This can be set for all queues with yarn.scheduler.capacity.maximum-applications and can also be overridden on a per queue basis by setting yarn.scheduler.capacity.<queue-path>.maximum-applications. 
Integer value expected.
