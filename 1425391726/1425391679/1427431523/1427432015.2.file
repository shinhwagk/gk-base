Each queue enforces a limit on the percentage of resources allocated to a user at any given time, if there is demand for resources. 
The user limit can vary between a minimum and maximum value. 
The the former (the minimum value) is set to this property value and the latter (the maximum value) depends on the number of users who have submitted applications. 
For e.g., suppose the value of this property is 25. 
If two users have submitted applications to a queue, no single user can use more than 50% of the queue resources. 
If a third user submits an application, no single user can use more than 33% of the queue resources. 
With 4 or more users, no user can use more than 25% of the queues resources.
 A value of 100 implies no user limits are imposed. The default is 100. 
Value is specified as a integer.
